In this project, I analyzed COVID-19 data using Microsoft SQL Server to uncover critical insights into the pandemic's progression and impact across various regions. 
The analysis focused on several key areas:

Mortality Analysis: 
By comparing total cases to total deaths, we determined the death percentage, providing insight into the fatality rate of COVID-19 in different countries.

Infection Rates: 
Assessing total cases against population figures revealed the percentage of the population infected, highlighting countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.

Vaccination Progress: 
By joining COVID-19 death data with vaccination records, we tracked vaccination rollouts and calculated the percentage of the population that has received at least one vaccine dose over time.

I employed various SQL techniques, including joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, window functions, aggregate functions, and views, to structure and analyze the data effectively. 
These methods facilitated comprehensive insights into the pandemic's trends and patterns.

Key Findings and Recommendations:
High Infection and Death Rates: 
The analysis revealed that certain countries, such as Peru and Bulgaria, experienced disproportionately high infection and death rates. For instance, Peru reported over 6,400 deaths per million citizens, the highest globally. These findings suggest a need for these nations to investigate underlying factors contributing to these elevated numbers and implement targeted public health interventions in case of such emergencies in the future.

Vaccination Efforts:
The study highlighted significant variation in vaccination rates worldwide. Countries like Japan achieved high vaccination coverage, with approximately 80.6% of the population fully vaccinated. In contrast, nations such as Yemen and the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported some of the lowest vaccination rates, with less than 2% of their populations fully vaccinated.


Data-Driven Policy Making: 
Governments and health organizations can leverage these insights to formulate policies that address specific challenges identified in the data, such as allocating resources to high-risk areas or tailoring public health messages to communities with low vaccination rates.
